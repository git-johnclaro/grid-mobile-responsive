        <div class="column1"><h2>User Experience</h2>
        <p class="__meaning">The user experience on the website is not very good. The website is difficult to navigate and it is not clear what the user is supposed to do. There is also no search bar, which makes it difficult for users to find what they are looking for.<br><a class="links1" href="https://www.productplan.com/glossary/user-experience/#:~:text=User%20Experience%20Definition%3A%20User%20Experience%20refers%20to%20the,use%2C%20how%20relevant%20the%20content%20displayed%20is%20etc.">User Experience</a></p>
        </div>
        <div class="column2"><h2>Content</h2>
        <p class="__meaning">The content of the website is all over the place. There is a mix of text, images, and videos, and it is not always clear what is for sale and what is not. There is also a lot of text in a foreign language (possibly Norwegian) which could be confusing for users who do not speak that language.<br><a class="links2" href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/content">Content</a></p>
        </div>
        <div class="column3"><h2>Grid Layout</h2>
        <p class="__meaning"> The website uses a grid layout, but it is not very well-organized. There is a lot of white space between the items, and the items themselves are not all the same size. This can make the page look cluttered and busy.<br><a class="links3" href="https://arounda.agency/blog/grid-layout-design-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work-a-guide-with-examples">Grid Layout</a></p>
